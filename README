Project 4 4760-E01
Author: Gabriel Murphy (gjmcn6)
Date: Mon Mar 20 STD 2017

Instructions: run cmd 'make' or 'make all' to compile both executables
of the project.
Then run cmd './OSS' to run the project with the default preferences.

Master accepts command line arguments to adjust properties of project:
			-h: displays help message
			-s [integer]: number of child processes spawned (max 18)
			-i [integer]: number of writes before child terminates
			-t [integer]: number of seconds master will wait
			-l [filename]: name of file where log will be written
			-c [integer]: amount sim time will be incremented

Default simulated sys time increment is 100, which goes semi quickly in testing
Can set custom with -c, but the interval must divide 1000000000.
			
I used git for version control. The hidden git folders are included
in my submission--in case they don't copy over I'll
also save 'git log' to a text file called gitlogbckup.txt
