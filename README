Project 4 4760-E01
Author: Gabriel Murphy (gjmcn6)
Date: Mon Mar 20 STD 2017

Instructions: run cmd 'make' or 'make all' to compile both executables
of the project.
Then run cmd './OSS' to run the project with the default preferences.

OSS accepts command line arguments to adjust properties of project:
			-h: displays help message
			-s [integer]: number of child processes spawned (max 18)
			-i [integer]: number of writes before child terminates
			-t [integer]: number of seconds master will wait
			-l [filename]: name of file where log will be written

These preferences, other than the file name, can also be set in a text file called
"pref.dat"--along with the other preference variables used to affect the operation
of the simulation. These of course can be set w/o re-compiling the project.
Each preference in "pref.dat" includes a description of what it sets/does.

The default preference values I decided on differ in some places from what was 
suggested in the assignment pdf. They were adjusted to get runs that always 
show the queueing etc. in action.

All messages are written to the log file. During execution, messages are printed to the terminal only when a new process is generated and when a process has terminated.

Termination of each process is decided randomly each time the process is scheduled
(of course with a lower probability than random interrupt). I had initially set
a random total time the process needed, but decided having a probability was
more in keeping with a simulation.

When a process is generated, its priority (which queue it goes in first) is
randomly decided with a heavy bias towards 0 (highest priority).

I used git for version control. The hidden git folders are included
in my submission.
